                        <p>I was born on June 3rd 1999. In a small city called, Carazinho in the state of Rio Grande do Sul in the Country of Brazil! My mother was widowed a few months before I was born. Because of this my sister Gabrielly and my mother Vania have always had each others backs.  After 10 years of moving around inside of Brazil we eventually moved to the United States of America.  We lived in Orlando Florida for about Three months before moving to Utah the state where we have called home since then.</p>
                        <p>It wasn't easy. I never felt as if I fit in anywhere with the American Kids at school. But eventually I found my way. I graduated from Bingham High School in 2018.  After about a year and a few months of just working, I decided that I was going to serve an LDS Mission.  I was eventually called to serve in the Brazil Belem Mission. Due to Covid-19 I was sent back home only 2 days prior to going out to my mission field.  I was eventually re-assigned to the Arizona Tempe Mission where I served for 9 Months before being called back to Brazil.  Where I was 1 of the 5 first Foreing Missionaries to get back into the Country.</p>
                        <p>I returned home at the end of 2021 and began working for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints as an IT Specialist helping church employees.  I worked there until I found out that I had been accepted to Attend BYU in the Fall of 2022 and that's when my latest chapter began! It's been a little bit since I first began College as I'm currently in my third semester.  And it took a while for me to figure things out but I feel as if things are happening as they are supposed to now.</p>
